# burger
homework due 11/26/2019     In this assignment, you'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

### Organization
This node.js app uses Express to create a user-interactive front end that communicates with the node.js backend, providing CREATE, UPDATE, and READ functionality. Handlebars handles our views, we're using MySQL for data storage, and a bespoke ORM handles our routing.

### How-to operate
* This web application is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. 

* Please peruse the list of available cheesesteak options. If you have eaten them, adjust the list accordingly! If you have not eaten them, Why are you wasting time?!?!

* If you'd like to add a hip cheesesteak spot, do it! The page allows user-input in the form of a textbox and submit button. This should add the hip new spot to the list of yet-to-be-consumed cheesesteaks.

* Now the question is cheese and accoutrements. I suggest "whiz wit" & "american wit". 

* If you normally finish your cheesesteaks early, as a bonus, try adding ' + "extra meat"'.

### Proof Positive
This web application is generously hosted for free by Heroku and is accessable to you at: https://mysterious-tor-31025.herokuapp.com/

However, should you want to host and view this on your local machine, clone the repository to your machine.
After cloning the repository, npm install to load all required third-party software. 
Following installation the user can initiate the program by entering "node server.js" in their cmd line. 
Next, the user will have to use a browser to navigate to "localhost:3000", which will display the interactive front end.

### Link to Github Repository
Please clone and install to run.

### Technologies used
This node.js app uses a package.json to facilitate installing third-party software, the "express", "express-handlebars", and "mysql" packages, a bespoke ORM, jQUERY, and of course javascript.
Github, Windows Powershell, and Heroku simplify deployment.
